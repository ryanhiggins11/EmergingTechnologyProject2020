EmergingTechnology Project 2020

## Overview
This is the repository for the emerging technologies modules project worth 50%. The project brief is displayed below and outlines what needs to be done in this project.

### The Brief
You must create a web service that uses machine learning to make predictions based on the data set powerproduction. The goal is to
produce a model that accurately predicts wind turbine power output from wind speed values, as in the data set. You must then develop a web service that will respond with predicted power values based on speed values sent as HTTP requests

1. Jupyter notebook that trains a model using the data set. In the notebook , explain your model and give an analysis of its accuracy.
2. Python script that runs a web service based on the model, as above.
3. Dockerfile to build and run the web service in a container.
4. Standard items in a git repository such as a README.

### Installations and Running the Webapp
For this project you are required to have the following installed:
Python
Flask
Tensorflow
Jupyter Notebook 

To run this project you must:
1) Download or clone the repository from Github.
2) Open a command window from the project directory
3) Use the command "set FLASK_APP=webapp.py".
4) Then Run the command "python -m flask run".

After you have run the last command it will then load up a URL which should then be copied and pasted into the browser you are using.
By doing this you will then be able to load the application.
